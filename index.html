        <p class="bio p1">My name is Lisa Freedman and I am a lawyer, 
          senior executive and full stack web developer.  I have a passion for 
          simplifying, synthesizing and disseminating information.  I want to teach every girl to code and help every senior 
          to easily use their new mobile devices.  I love to teach and I firmly
           believe that every concept can be simplified so it can be explained to a five year old - whether this is why the sky is blue
          or how to code io apps with Swift.</p>
        <p class="bio p2">
          In addition to teaching, I've discovered that there are a lack of apps aimed at Seniors that help them ease the transition
          to working on a mobile device for perhaps the first time.  This transition
           should be able to be done with enthusiasm and not frustration.
        </p>
        <p class="bio p3">And finally, I want to build games.  I first learned DOS because I needed to install drivers to get my games to work.  Over the years my children have been the happy recipients of my gaming passion.  I always had the latest platform.  
          While Mario Kart will always be a favourite, I'm somehow addicted to
           time management games on my I.  I am also compulsively interested 
           in learning the psychology behind games; What is it that addicts
            us and keeps us playing all night?
        </p>

        <p>In my spare time I relish my role as "Cool Mom".</p>
